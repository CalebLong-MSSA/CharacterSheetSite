When I’m not swamped with work and life, I enjoy playing tabletop board games and RPGs. Often, it can be tedious to keep track of your created characters and all of the sheets for their stats, abilities, inventory, etc. Furthermore, COVID-19 has made it so that all of these games have to be played over the internet. This means everything that was once simple pen and paper is now stored on subpar word documents and PDFs. While these work, they often are hard to find pre-made and can be a hassle to send between players.

Thus, I have decided to create a website to do away with the trouble entirely and present it all to users in one website. For initial release, my website will only cover Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, as this is currently the most popular tabletop RPG on the market. The main page of the website will prompt users to sign in or register for an account using email and a password. Once registered, users will be given the options to access their character sheets, access shared character sheets in their group, or to form/join a group. Here’s a list of some features:

* Ability to create and edit character sheets.
  * Character stats
  * Health pool
  * Armor value
  * Active weapon and modifiers
  * Character abilities
  * Character background and attributes
  * (If possible) Character reference picture
* For characters with abilities that have a limited number of uses, a Spell Book that can track their slotted abilities, how many uses they have left, and their inactive abilities.
* A separate sheet (may be integrated to the main character sheet if not too overcrowded) to manage the character’s inventory and currency.
  * Ability to choose which weapon is equipped and which armor is equipped, automatically updating the ‘active weapon’ and ‘armor value’ on the main sheet.
* Ability to save multiple character sheets and inventories.
  * Sheets can be saved in files separated by what their base class is for easier organization.
* Create and join campaign groups.
  * Members of the group can put their character sheets in a shared repository so the player running the campaign can easily access everyone else’s sheets.
* Automatic dice roller, where users can input how many dice need to be rolled, what kind of dice they need to be, and what modifiers to apply to them.
  * For example, two five-sided dice with a +2 modifier to the final roll.

A major benefit of this system is the ability to access your sheets from any machine and the sheets are available to your friends without the hassle of sending them to each other. Access your sheets and your friend’s shared sheets anytime you like from any device. The MVP for this website would be just the basic ability to create and save character sheets through registered accounts.
